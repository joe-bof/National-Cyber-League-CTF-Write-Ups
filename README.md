CTF write-ups for the National Cyber League (NCL)

Write-ups for NCL CTF challenges.
NCL is an extensive cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF) event. 
Challenges have different categories; e.g. cryptography, forensics, etc. 
They take time to complete, and write-ups have been an extra project for me. 
These are all the following write-ups I've done for the NCL challenge thus far. 
They are in the MS Word format so users can easily add in their own comments if necessary.

NCL often has hints to solve the challenge within its title and the pictures near its title.
	>E.g. in challenge titled "Tasty," you need to use the "yum" software.  There was also a picture of a hat near the title,
	 indicating that the the provided terminal was running a Red Hat Linux (RHL) distro, which was important to the challenge.
	>E.g. in the challenge titled "Magic Bytes," understanding what Magic Bytes are was vital to solving the challenge.

There are NCL online help resources to give pointers and tool recommendations.  If you get stuck on a challenge, try Googling
 the type of challenge, tool, etc. with the "NCL" keyword in your query. A good NCL blog resource is: https://cryptokait.com/

This folder conatains write-ups from both individual and team competitions.

Information about challenges are in their titles: respectively the challenge title, difficuluty, competition type, season, and year.

	>E.g. a file titled "Cracking (Medium) -TeamS2021" has the following attributes:
		*challenge title = Cracking
		*difficulty = Medium
		*competition type = Team
		*season = Spring
		*year = 2021

I use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, so all terminal references and screenshots are with this distro and version.
